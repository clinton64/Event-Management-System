# Event-Management-System
A web application for better management of Events. Create events, choose from available venues and send invitations through emails.
The app is made database agnostic. I used MySQL and PostgreSQL . <br>
**Features** : send email and make PDF <br>
To run the project in your local machine, install the modules in requirements.txt. <br>
Add a .env file and add EMAIL= "" and PASSWORD= "" field . you should provide your own email and pass(better create a temporary email)<br>
In the dbConfig.json file, add your own database configurations<br>
